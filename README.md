# Critical signs

This repository hosts work editing MS texts documenting ancient critical signs.

Dindorf summarized the most important manuscript sources in the introduction to his edition of the *scholia* to the *Iliad* in the Venetus A manuscript  (section II, "Excerpta de signis criticis," pp. xlii-l). In the same publicaiton, he edited the Venetus A fragment of Aristonicus (pp. 1-2).  Since Dindorf's publicaiotn, some of the manuscripts have been recataloged; others have digitized.  We list their availability in 2020:


- (Greek material published by Ossan formerly in the Collegio Romano)
- (material included in two MSS of Hephaestion, Ἐγχειρίδιον περὶ μέτρων, in Bodleian and in Venice)
- Harley codex 5693: citable images available on HMT web site
- Paris 7530: gramatical treatise attributed to Suetonius
- Aristonicus, *On Signs*: fragment on folio 8 of the Venetus A (Marciana 454 = 822).
